# tetengger
A free bookmark service powered by GitHub. 

## Motivation

Nowadays, you will face a situation where you need to read and search so many things in the internet. Sometimes, you need to go back on what you've read.

How to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency to find something that you've read? yes, you know it. You need to save or bookmark that information.

Many services are available to solve this problem (i.e. [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/u), [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/), [pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/), etc...). Of course they are offering a good service,  but why I created this? the simple reason is just to save money (*lol*), make the most on the free resources, and contribute to open source :)

*fun fact*: tetengger is *marker* in *sundanese* (one of the local language in Indonesia).
